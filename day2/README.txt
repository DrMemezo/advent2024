THE CODE FOR PART 2 IS INCOMPLETE!

In part 2, My solution involves checking if a record is invalid,
then removing the levels near the invalid record,
For some reason, this is not the correct approach, and i dont want
to be stuck on this problem for so long.

You're welcome to view my code, but don't use it.
